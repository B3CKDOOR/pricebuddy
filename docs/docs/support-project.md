# Support PriceBuddy

PriceBuddy was whipped up in my spare time to snag some sweet 
deals on stuff I buy regularly or things I had my eye on. Turns 
out, a lot of folks have the same itch, so I thought I'd share 
the love.

Keeping an app running smoothly takes a ton of time and effort, 
so if you find it handy and want to throw some support my way, 
here are a few ways to do it:

## Affiliate codes

This is the easiest method because you have to **do absolutely nothing**. 
Well, almost nothing. If you're buying something through PriceBuddy, 
just use the link in the app.

My affiliate code will sneak its way into some store URLs. If you'd 
rather not have any affiliate codes added, no worries, just set 
the environment variable `AFFILIATE_ENABLED=false`.

You can also add your own affiliate codes, see the config file
[here](https://github.com/jez500/pricebuddy/blob/main/config/affiliates.php)
for the environment variables you can set.

NOTE: If you add a URL that already has an affiliate code, PriceBuddy will
NOT override it.

## Buy me a coffee

If you want to support me directly, you can buy me a coffee. I love coffee,
and it's ridiculously expensive these days.

## Contribute

If you're a developer and want to pitch in, you can fork the repo and 
submit a PR. I'm always on the lookout for ways to make things better.
