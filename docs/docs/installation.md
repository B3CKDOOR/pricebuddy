# Installation

The recommended way to install PriceBuddy is via Docker. This will ensure that all 
dependencies are installed and configured correctly. A `docker-compose.yml` file is
provided to make this easy.

## Quick start

```shell
mkdir pricebuddy
cd pricebuddy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jez500/pricebuddy/main/docker-compose.yml
touch .env
docker compose up -d
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The default username is 
`admin@example.com` and the default password is `admin`.

NOTES:
* You should look at the `docker-compose.yml` to ensure you are happy with the default
  settings, ports, environment variables, etc.
* If you are getting a 500 error, it is likely due to a missing `.env` file. You can
  create an empty one next to the `docker-compose.yml` file with `touch .env`.

## Database

The docker compose file includes a mysql database. You can use an external database if
you prefer, see [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/database#introduction)
for supported databases. 

Note `sqllite` is not supported due to the use of `json` columns.

## Persistent storage / volumes

The docker compose file includes volumes for the database and the app. Not much is 
stored in the app volume so it won't need a lot of space.

## Environment variables

You can refer to [.env.example](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/11.x/.env.example)
file for the environment variables that can be set.

If you just use the variables set in the docker compose file, you should be good to go.

## Debugging install

The `docker-compose.yml` file has been tested to get you up and running quickly. You 
should create an `.env` file next to the docker-compose file otherwise docker will
create a directory. The installation should setup the database schema, add default 
content and users.

If you have any issues, you can run the following commands to see what is happening:

```shell
docker compose exec -it app cat /app/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

You can also enable debugging via environment variables:

```shell
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
```
