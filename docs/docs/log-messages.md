# Log messages

A lot happens behind the scenes in PriceBuddy, this is where you can 
see details of anything that might have gone wrong. This is particularly
useful for when debugging why a product isn't updating or why a notification
didn't get sent.

## Log retention

By default logs are kept for 30 days, you can change this in the settings.
