# Tags

Tags are used to categorize your products. You can add multiple tags
to a product to help you organize them. 

Tags are unique to the user who has added them, so you will only see the tags
that you have added to your account.

## Adding a tag

You can add new tags via the tags page or when adding a product.

## Filtering by tag

There is a tag filter on the product listing page, you can add one or more tags
to filter the products by.

## Tags on the dashboard

Products will be grouped by tag on the dashboard, if a product does not have a
tag it will be grouped under `Uncategorized`.
