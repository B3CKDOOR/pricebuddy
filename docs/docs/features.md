# Features

## Works with almost any store

Many stores are included by default, but if your favourite store isn't there, 
you can add it yourself.

Stores can be scraped using CSS selectors, regular expressions or JSONPath.

## Compare prices from multiple stores

Add multiple urls to a product to compare prices from different stores
(or even the same store - eg eBay listings).

## Price history

Visualise price changes over time with charts. See the min, max and average prices
Quickly identify trends and decide when to buy.

## Support for JS rendered sites

A headless browser can be used to scrape sites that require Javascript to render 
the page. This is done via [Scrapper](https://github.com/amerkurev/scrapper).

## Organise your products

Tag products to better organise them. Tags can be used to filter products on the
dashboard.

## Multi-user support

Each user has their own products, tags and settings. Great for sharing with others
who want to track their own products.

## Notifications

Support for multiple notification methods so users can be updated when a product
price changes to match their preferences.

## Modern UI

Support for light and dark mode. Fully mobile friendly and easy to use.

## Integration with SearXNG

Use your instance of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) to make it 
easier to search for products and add urls within the app.

## Open source and self-hostable

PriceBuddy is open source and self-hostable. You can run it on your own server
and have full control over your data.
